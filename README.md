# VBA-challenge
In this repo I have the following files:
Testing file called alphabetical testing - xls file
Working file real data - xls file called Multiple_year_stock_data
4 x screenshots of the script results for each quarter
Separate script file for the vba module which was exported from the working file

The purpose of this was to learn to code with VBA across multiple worksheets in a workbook
